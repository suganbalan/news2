            <h3>Uttarakhand rains: 16 dead,6 criticals,450 standed;Kedarnath shrine cutt off</h3>
            <p>All district magistrates were instructed to work closely with local teams and ensure public safety without any compromise on disaster-related updates. Earlier, the Uttarakhand government issued a safety alert for Chardham Yatra pilgrims due to predicted heavy rainfall throughout the state.
                As many as 14 people have lost their lives and 10 others have been injured due to severe overnight rains that caused flooding and a house collapse in Uttarakhand, according to officials on Thursday.
 
The heavy rainfall led to swollen rivers and landslides in several areas. As a result, the Kedarnath Yatra has been suspended due to hazardous weather conditions. The trekking routes have been obstructed by boulders at Ghoraparav, Lincholi, Badi Lincholi, and Bhimbali.
Uttarakhand rains: Rescue operation on
In response to the situation, the Uttarakhand government announced that the Centre has deployed two Indian Air Force helicopters — a Chinook and an MI 17 — to assist with rescue operations. This action follows a review by the Prime Minister’s Office regarding the severe weather impact.

            <h3>Deadpool and Wolverine isn’t just a bad movie – it’s changing the definition of what a ‘movie’ is</h3>
            <p>hat is a movie? It sounds like a silly question, perhaps, but it’s one that’s been rattling around my head ever since I walked out of Deadpool & Wolverine last Friday. Marvel’s cameo-stuffed, fourth-wall-breaking superhero sequel made a staggering $438.3m across its opening weekend – a record for an R-rated film. It feels in many ways like a watershed moment. But not a good one. If we are watching, as some critics have suggested, the death of cinema happen before our eyes, then it’s taken the form of a public execution.

                There have been plenty of “worse” movies than Deadpool & Wolverine. Even within the remit of Marvel’s own conveyor-belt oeuvre, last year’s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and 2022’s Thor: Love and Thunder were far messier affairs – structurally chaotic and aesthetically rebarbative to an extent that Deadpool & Wolverine is not. But Deadpool feels somehow the most cynical of all of the canon to date, the most spiritually and creatively bereft. It is a film that is about absolutely nothing – a film with no discernable purpose or artistic ambitions, beyond the perpetuation of its own corporate myth.
                
                There are jokes about the Disney-Fox merger. Jokes about producer Kevin Feige. Jokes about the widespread disillusionment towards the Marvel franchise. Around halfway through the film, the two eponymous leads (played by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, the latter exhuming – literally at one point – his famous X-Men character) encounter a team of throwback superheroes: Jennifer Garner’s Elektra, Wesley Snipes’ Blade, Chris Evans’s Johnny Storm (from Fantastic Four), Channing Tatum’s Gambit (never produced) and Dafne Keen’s mini-Wolverine from Logan.
                
                The film invites us to gawp at these comebacks. Meta-referential dialogue explains that these characters, ostensibly stuck in some kind of out-of-universe “void”, are simply trying to get the endings they deserve. What these “deserved endings” actually look like in practice is fewer than 10 lines of dialogue apiece – in Snipes’ case, mostly just repeating catchphrases from the first three Blade films – before they all drive out to a skirmish in the desert and get swallowed up by some kind of deadly CGI air monster. There’s no attempt at characterisation, no point behind the meta-joke. The insistence that audiences are for some reason gagging to see Reynolds’ Deadpool exchange one line of insipid banter with Tatum’s Gambit, is baffling. Audiences didn’t love Blade because Snipes just showed up, stood there and barked catchphrases – he was part of a story, with a proper character, and stakes, and intentionality. That Marvel cannot see the difference – or, even worse, if it can see the difference but chooses to ignore it – is surely damning.</p>
